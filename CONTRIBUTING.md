# Contributing

First, thank you for wanting to contribute! To make it a pleasant process, here are the guidelines.

- Search (pull requests)[https://github.com/bruth/awesome-time/pulls] and [issues](https://github.com/bruth/awesome-time/issues) before suggesting a new one to prevent duplicates.
- Submit one item per Pull Request with the format `- [item name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`.
- If the item falls under a new topic, add the section with a description and an anchor to the Table of Contents.
- The Pull Request should state why the item is awesome.
- Check your spelling and grammar and remove any trailing whitespace.
